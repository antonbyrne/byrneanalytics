<h2>Irish Government Spending Trends</h2>
        <p>
            In recent years, Irish public spending has expanded steadily, reaching approximately €116 billion in 2024, up from €107.5 billion in 2023 and €96.3 billion in 2022 according to official “Where Your Money Goes” figures. The 2025 budget projects further growth to around €120 billion, reflecting a strong commitment to funding key sectors like health, education, and housing. While this spending surge supports essential services, it also places pressure on the public finances, requiring a careful balance in upcoming budgets.

            Social protection and healthcare remain the largest single expenditures. In 2023, social protection spending reached €63.5 billion, up 7% from 2022—accounting for 12% of GDP and a significant increase in housing supports, partly due to refugee assistance. Healthcare spending exceeded €33.5 billion in the same year, growing nearly 7% — driven largely by rising costs and COVID‑19 aftermath. These areas now consume roughly half of all government expenditure, leaving less room for discretionary and capital budgets.

            Despite high total spending, Ireland managed a government surplus of €7.5 billion (1.5% of GDP) in 2023, though this was down from the prior year’s €8.6 billion (1.7%) surplus. Debt levels also slightly declined, with gross debt falling to €220.7 billion (43.3% of GDP). Capital investment under the National Development Plan increased substantially, with core capital spending rising to €12.6 billion in 2024, particularly in transport, housing, and climate-related infrastructure. This suggests a fiscal policy focused on investing for future growth, while maintaining prudent control over the national balance sheet.
